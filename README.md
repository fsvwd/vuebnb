# Vuebnb

Source code for the "Vuebnb" project app from the book *Full Stack Vue Web Development: Vue.js, Vuex and Laravel* by Anthony Gore, published by Packt Publishing.

## Chapters

This repository has the required code for chapters 3 through 11 of the book. If you're looking for the code for chapter 2, check [this repository](https://github.com/fsvwd/vuebnb-prototype).

The state of the code for different chapters has been applied to different branches of the repository. The **master** branch is the completed project code. The other branches have the initial state of Vuebnb for that particular chapter. For example, branch **ch-03** is the code you'll need at the start of chapter 3. If you want to see the *completed* code for chapter 3, look at branch **ch-04**.

## Checking out a branch

When you clone this code I recommend you checkout the branch of the chapter you're working on. For example, to get the code for chapter 6:

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/vuejsdevelopers/vuebnb.git -b ch-06
```
